## Alexa Skills

I've created an skill of Alexa with nodeJS and Lamdba.

## Deployment

I've used Alexa-hosted in nodeJS:

Alexa will host skills in your account and get you started with a Node.js template. 
You will gain access to AWS Lambda endpoints in all Alexa service regions, 
a DynamoDB table for data persistence, 
and S3 for media storage

### Intents

I've created intents in a json file. 
The intents are necesary to trainning the bot. 


## Code

The code is a Lambda function in nodeJS.
